# Images (Glance)

If you are unfamiliar with an OpenStack image then you can think of it as a "virtual machine template".  Images can also be standard installation media such as ISO images.  

<div class="alert alert-danger"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The <b><i>Image</i></b> objects shown in these examples are not from the "compute" model package but referenced from the <b>org.openstack4j.model.image</b> package.</div>

## Creating, Reserving and Uploading Images

If an image (template) is created without uploading the media then it is what is known as a reserved state. A reserved state means we have reserved a placeholder but it contains no image data (uploaded media).  The status will be marked as `Queued` when in a reserve state.   OpenStack4j will automatically change a create operation into a reserve operation if the image data/media is not defined.

#### Create and Upload an Image in a single call

To create and upload the image media in a single call see the example below:

```java
// Create a Payload - we will use URL in this example
Payload<URL> payload = Payloads.create(new URL("https://some/url/cirros-0.3.0-x86_64-disk.img"));

Image image = os.images().create(Builders.image()
        .name("Cirros 0.3.0 x64")
        .isPublic(true)
        .containerFormat(ContainerFormat.BARE)
        .diskFormat(DiskFormat.QCOW2)
        .build()
        ), payload);
```

#### Reserve an Image

```java
Image image = os.images().reserve(Builders.image()
        .name("Cirros 0.3.0 x64")
        .isPublic(true)
        .build());
```

	
#### Uploading Image Data

To upload image data/media see the examples below.

**Uploading an Updating an image object already assigned**

```java
image = os.images().upload(image.getId(), 
        Payloads.create(new File("/path/to/vmimage.img")), 
        image.builder().containerFormat(ContainerFormat.BARE).diskFormat(DiskFormat.QCOW2));
```
	

**Uploading only the image data without updating**

```java
os.images().upload("imageId", Payloads.create(new File("/path/to/vmimage.img"), null);
```
	
## Updating, Deleting and Querying

#### Updating an Image

To update an image like changing it's name or other template data see the example below.

```java
os.images().update(image.toBuilder()
        .name("New VM Image Name").minDisk(1024).property("personal-distro", "true"));
```
	
#### Delete an Image

To permanently delete an image see the example below.

 ```java
os.images().delete("imageId");
```

#### Querying for Images

```java
// List all Images
List<? extends Image> images = os.images().list();
    
// Get an Image by ID
Image image = os.images().get("imageId");
```	

## Image Memberships

Image memberships are a way to share a private image with other tenants.  Those tenants can also be assigned rights to re-share the private image.  Public images are available but private images require memberships for non-owners to access.

**Finding all Memberships for an Image**

```java
List<? extends ImageMember> members = os.images().listMembers("imageId");
```

**Adding a Member (authorizing a tenant for a private image)**

```java
os.images().addMember("imageId", "tenantId");
```
	
**Removing a Member (revoking a tenant)**

```java
os.images().removeMember("imageId", "tenantId");
```
